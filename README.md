# Thermal_Laser_Compression_Model

Finite Element Model (FEM) high temperature thermal laser compression for deriving conductivity and diffusivity.


## Dependencies
Python 3.8 is required. Currently, this model uses the python engine for matlab to run the MATLAB FEM in python. The engine is only compatible with these versions of Python.
