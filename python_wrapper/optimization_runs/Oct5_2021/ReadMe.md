# Optimization runs on Tuesday, October 5, 2021

# Run 1
Restarting the run from yesterday
- Trying to optimize from "random" parameters, but ones that are reasonably close to the ones that I have been using
- initial parameters: params0=[20000, 0.017, 30, 20ns]
- the fit seems not to optimize to a "good fit" and is instead moving the start_time to well before the data begins, then sending what appear to be relatively flat curves to fit the data curves optimally


# Run 2
- Fitting the optimal curves again (using the first 2 faces from each run)

# Run 3


# Run 4
- running the optimization for only s88773
- starting parameters:
    -  params0=[36000.0, 0.017, 30.0, 2.0*10**-8]

- optimizing the s88773 run to convergence to determine some k value/equation that works well in the optimization algorithm
