# Summary of Optimizations on September 29, 2021

## Run 1
starting parameters:
    params0=[36000.0,0.017,30,2.0*10**-8]

Run Notes:
    - quit run part way through because the start_time was being left unaffected
    - running the same thing for next run while troubleshooting the problem

## Run 2
starting parameters:
    params0=[36000.0,0.017,30,2.0*10**-8]

Run notes:
    - same as the previous run, but with the original one censored
    - mid-run, it appears that it looks like the time problem is getting better

## Run 3
starting parameters:
    params0=[36000.0,0.017,30,2.0*10**-8]

- now trying to isolate some desirable data curves
    - 

## Run 4 
starting parameters:
    params0=[36000.0,0.017,30,2.0*10**-8]

- redoing a fit with all runs at all curves because:
    1. i didn't realize it but I've been only fitting some curves this whole time
    2.
