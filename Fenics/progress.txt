Forgot to update progress.txt???

To do:
  - update README file in Fenics subfolder
  - create Default formats for the excel files
  - Define function/script for reading in all files that are in the data folder (using default formats) & putting them in an organized JSON file like with the other data
  - put all functions/files in one place
  - rewrite code to be more pythonic
    - write classes (I have no classes right now)

Have to figure out what is going wrong with the function and where. For starters, I think I have mixed up start_time and peak_temp

Okay, Now I've narrowed it down to:
  in opt_func.py the function only runs because I do "import optimize"
    the code executes upon being imported
    have to fix this function, then go from here
